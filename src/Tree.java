/*
    Carmen Chau's understanding of adts.py
    There is the MultiSet ADT. This ADT is like a "blueprint" that models the development of the followung classes
        1. TreeMultiSet (this not only uses the MultiSet ADT but also uses another class called Tree)
        2. ArrayListMultiSet
        3. LinkedListMultiSet

     Finally, there is a 4th thing to implement:
        4. A method called profileMultiSet that runs timing experiments for a given MultiSet implementation
